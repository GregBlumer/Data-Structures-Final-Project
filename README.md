# Data-Structures-Final-Project
For our project we will use a linked list to make a schedule planning type program. The code's purpose will be to have a user enter in singular or multiple tasks that they need to do that day, and the program will keep track of that data, what time the tasks needs to completed by, and the priority level of the task. The program would also include the ability to clear the persons schedule or for the person to delete tasks off their schedule.
